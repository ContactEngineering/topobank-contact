Contents of this ZIP archive
============================
This archive contains data from contact mechanics calculation.

Each directory corresponds to one measurement and is named after the measurement.
Inside you find two types of files:

- a simple CSV file ('plot.csv')
- a couple of classical netCDF files (Extension '.nc')

The file 'plot.csv' contains a table with the data used in the plot,
one line for each calculation step. It has the following columns:

- Zero-based index column
- Normalized pressure in units of p/E*
- Fractional contact area in units of A/A0
- Normalized mean gap in units of u/h_rms
- A boolean flag (True/False) which indicates whether the calculation converged
  within the given limit
- Filename of the NetCDF file (order of filenames may be different than index)

So each line also refers to one NetCDF file in the directory, it corresponds to
one external pressure. Inside the NetCDF file you'll find the variables

* `contact_points`: boolean array, true if point is in contact
* `pressure`: floating-point array containing local pressure (in units of `E*`)
* `gap`: floating-point array containing the local gap
* `displacement`: floating-point array containing the local displacements

as well as the attributes

* `mean_pressure`: mean pressure (in units of `E*`)
* `total_contact_area`: total contact area (fractional)

Accessing the CSV file
======================

Inside the archive you find a file "plot.csv" which contains the data
from the plot.

With Python and numpy you can load it e.g. like this:

```
import numpy as np
pressure_contact_area = np.loadtxt("plot.csv", delimiter=",",
                                   skiprows=1, usecols=(1,2))
```

With pandas, you can do:

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("plot.csv", index_col=0)
```

Accessing the NetCDF files
==========================

In order to read the data for each point,
you can use a netCDF library. Please see the following examples:

### Python

Given the package [`netcdf4-python`](http://netcdf4-python.googlecode.com/) is installed:

```
import netCDF4
ds = netCDF4.Dataset("result-step-0.nc")
print(ds)
pressure = ds['pressure'][:]
mean_pressure = ds.mean_pressure
```

Another convenient package you can use is [`xarray`](xarray.pydata.org/).

### Matlab

In order to read the pressure map in Matlab, use

```
ncid = netcdf.open("result-step-0.nc", 'NC_NOWRITE');
varid = netcdf.inqVarID(ncid, "pressure");
pressure = netcdf.getVar(ncid, varid);
```

Have look in the official Matlab documentation for more information.

Version information
===================

For version information of the packages used, please look into the files named
'info.txt' in the subdirectories for each measurement. The versions of the packages
used for analysis may differ among measurements, because they may have been
calculated at different times.
